#  Casino gaming finally arrives in the Philippines!

The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) has announced that it will be issuing new licenses for casino operators in the country. This is great news for casino enthusiasts, who have been eagerly waiting for casino gaming to arrive in the Philippines.

The first batch of licenses will be issued in March 2017, and interested parties can apply through the PAGCOR website. The requirements for licensing include a minimum capital investment of PHP5 billion, as well as a commitment to create at least 1,000 jobs.

The Philippines has long been seen as an attractive destination for casino gaming, thanks to its location close to China and other Asian markets. In addition, the government has been keen to attract investors and boost tourism.

Casino gaming is expected to bring in billions of dollars in revenue each year, and is likely to create thousands of jobs in the process. This is great news for the Philippines economy, and is sure to benefit both locals and tourists alike.

#  Philippines opens its very first legal casino!

The Philippines is a gambling-friendly country, and this is evidenced by the opening of its first legal casino. The resort-style casino, called City of Dreams Manila, is owned by the Genting Group. It has been in development for many years, and it finally opened its doors to the public on December 14th, 2014.

City of Dreams Manila is a large complex that includes a hotel, a shopping mall, and of course, the casino itself. There are over 500 gaming tables and 2,000 slot machines on offer at the new casino. The gambling floor also features a number of high-end restaurants and bars.

The launch of City of Dreams Manila was greeted with much fanfare. Guests included celebrities such as Heart Evangelista and Jericho Rosales. The opening ceremony was attended by top officials from both the Philippines and Malaysia. Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin was in attendance and he praised the Genting Group for their investment in the Philippines.

City of Dreams Manila is not just any old casino resort; it is designed to attract high-rollers from all over Asia. There are VIP gaming rooms available, as well as villas that can be rented out for extended stays. In addition, there are health and wellness facilities on site, which are open to both guests and non-guests alike.

The Genting Group has big plans for City of Dreams Manila. They hope to make it the premier gambling destination in Southeast Asia. Judging by the initial response to the casino, it seems that they are well on their way to achieving this goal.
