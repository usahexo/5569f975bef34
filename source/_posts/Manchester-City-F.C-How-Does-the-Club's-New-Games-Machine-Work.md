#  Manchester City F.C: How Does the Club's New Games Machine Work?

Manchester City F.C. started the new Premier League games machine in great form, winning their first 3 games of the season. But Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side hit a brick wall in their fourth game as they failed to score in a 0-0 draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers.

So, how does Manchester City's new games machine work? How did they go from winning three games to drawing their next game? And what do they need to do to make sure they don't lose points in the future?

The main problem for Manchester City is that they are not creating enough chances. In their first three games of the season, they averaged 9.3 shots per match, with an accuracy rate of 54%. However, in their fourth game against Wolves, they only managed 5 shots on target, and out of these only one was from inside the area. This lack of chances being created could be due to several factors: a lack of width in the team, playing with two defensive midfielders instead of one, or being too predictable in their attacks.

One possible solution to this problem is to change the system back to four at the back and play with one defensive midfielder instead of two. This would give more space and opportunities for Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sane on the wings and could lead to more chances being created. Additionally, playing with one defensive midfielder would also free up David Silva and Kevin de Bruyne to get into more dangerous positions and create more chances for the team.

If Manchester City can address these problems quickly then they should have no trouble picking up more wins and moving up the table. However, if these issues persist then they may start to lose points and struggle to compete for Premier League glory this season.

#  Manchester City F.C: How The Club's New Games Machine Operates 

Manchester City F.C. is one of the most popular clubs in the world and they are known for their aggressive, attacking style of play. This style of play has helped them become one of the most successful clubs in England and Europe.

In this article, we will take a look at how Manchester City's new games machine operates and how it helps them create chances and score goals. We will also look at some of the players that make up this machine and how they contribute to its success.

The first player we will look at is Sergio Aguero. Aguero is a prolific striker who always seems to find the back of the net. He is often used as a focal point for Manchester City's attacks and his goals have helped them win numerous trophies.

Another key player for Manchester City is Kevin De Bruyne. De Bruyne is a midfielder who likes to get on the ball and create chances for his teammates. He has been in excellent form this season and his goals and assists have helped Manchester City stay at the top of the Premier League table.

The final player we will look at is David Silva. Silva is a playmaker who dictates the tempo of Manchester City's attacks. He has been with the club since 2010 and his creative passing has been instrumental in their success.

Manchester City's new games machine operates by using quick passes and movement to create chances for their strikers. This style of play often causes problems for opposition defences, as they struggle to keep track of all the players involved in the attack.

The players mentioned above are some of the key contributors to this style of play, but there are also other players who play an important role in making it work. Players like Fernandinho, Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sane all work hard off the ball to help their team create chances.

Manchester City's new games machine is starting to operate like a well-oiled machine, thanks to the hard work and talent of its players. The club are currently on course for another successful season and there is no doubt that this style of play will continue to help them achieve great things.
