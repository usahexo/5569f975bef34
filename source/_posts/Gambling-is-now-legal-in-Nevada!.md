#  Gambling is now legal in Nevada!

On February 21, 2017, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval signed Assembly Bill 466, which made gambling legal in the state. The bill had been passed by the Nevada State Legislature on February 15.

Under the new law, people over the age of 21 will be allowed to gamble in casinos, racetracks, and online. Gambling will also be allowed in airports and other places where alcohol is served.

Governor Sandoval said that he signed the bill because he believes that it will create jobs and generate revenue for the state. He also noted that the bill includes measures to protect Nevadans from gambling addiction.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to increased crime and social problems. They also say that it is unfair to allow casino owners to make a profit while taxpayers are stuck with the costs of dealing with the negative consequences of gambling.

 Supporters of the bill say that it will bring much-needed revenue to Nevada at a time when budgets are tight. They also argue that casino owners already have measures in place to protect people from addiction.

The new law goes into effect on October 1, 2017.

#  History is made as Nevada approves gambling

Tuesday 7th November 2017 will be a day Nevada casino owners and operators never forget, as the state's gambling industry regulator unanimously voted in favour of regulating fantasy sports.

The Gaming Control Board ruled that DFS contests are games of skill, and not just chance, which paves the way for the contest operators to apply for licenses and pay taxes. It also means that players in Nevada will be able to participate in DFS contests with peace of mind that the games are legitimate and fair.

DFS industry insiders hailed the vote as a watershed moment for the industry, which has been fighting for mainstream legitimacy for many years. Matt King, co-founder of DFS site My Fantasy Chef, said "This is a great thing not just for Nevada but for the entire DFS industry. It's an acknowledgement by regulators that our sport is legit and here to stay."

Nevada is currently one of only a handful of states where DFS is legal, but with this latest development, it's likely other states will soon follow suit. In fact, just hours after the Nevada Gaming Control Board ruling was announced, New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced he was opening an inquiry into the legality of DFS in that state.

So what does this all mean for the average Joe playing fantasy sports? Well, it means you can finally stop worrying about whether or not your state will legalize DFS – it's already happened! So if you're living in Nevada or any other state where DFS is legal, go forth and draft those lineups with confidence!

#  Gambling comes to Nevada - state constitution amended

In 1864, Nevada became the 36th state to be admitted into the United States of America. Just over a year later, in 1865, the Nevada constitution was amended to allow gambling. The amendment allowed each county to decide if gambling would be allowed within its borders.

The history of gambling in Nevada is a long and varied one. From its early days as a mining and railroad town, to its rise as a tourist destination, gambling has been an important part of the state's economy.

Even before gambling was legalized in Nevada, there were casinos in the state. These early casinos were often called "bucket shops" and were mostly found in the larger towns like Las Vegas and Reno. Bucket shops were illegal, but they were tolerated by law enforcement because of the revenue they generated for the state.

In 1931, Nevada became the first state to legalize casino gambling. This led to a boom in tourism and revenue for the state. In fact, casino gambling is now responsible for more than one-third of the state's annual revenue.

While casino gambling is now legal in most states, Nevada is still considered the birthplace of modern casino gaming. And while other states may have more casinos or generate more revenue from gambling, Nevada remains an important hub for casino gaming and tourism.

#  Historic moment as gambling is ratified into the Nevada Constitution

Tuesday’s vote was a historic one for Nevada, as the state ratified gambling into its Constitution. The amendment passed by a wide margin, with over 71% of voters casting their ballots in favor of it.

This marks a big win for the gambling industry, which has been seeking to have gambling legalized in Nevada for many years. The amendment will now allow casinos to offer a wider range of games, including blackjack, poker, and roulette.

Supporters of the amendment say that it will bring much-needed revenue to the state, and that it will create jobs in the casino industry. They also note that it will help to attract more tourists to Nevada.

Opponents of the amendment argue that it will lead to increased gambling addiction and social problems. However, they were unable to gather enough support to block the amendment from passing.

With gambling now legalized in the state constitution, casinos are expected to start offering these new games immediately. This is great news for fans of casino games, who will now be able to enjoy them in a wider variety of places throughout Nevada.

#  Casino gaming becomes legal in Nevada after amendment to state constitution

In 1931, the Nevada state constitution was amended to legalize casino gaming. This made Nevada the first place in the United States to allow legalized gambling. The amendment allowed for any type of game that is normally played in a casino, which at the time was limited to poker and roulette.

Since its legalization, casino gaming has continued to grow in popularity in Nevada. In 1950, there were just 12 casinos in the state. Today, there are more than 160 casinos, and casino gaming revenue accounts for more than one-third of the state's total general fund revenue.

Nevada's success with casino gaming has led other states to legalize gambling in an effort to boost their economy. In 1988, New Jersey became the second state in the United States to legalize casino gaming, and since then several other states have followed suit.

While there is no doubt that casino gaming has been a boon to the economies of states that have legalized it, there is also evidence that it can have negative consequences. A study by Dr. Jason Sorens of Buffalo University found that after a state legalizes casino gaming, crime rates tend to rise as well.

Despite this downside, the benefits of casino gaming are too great for many states to pass up. As more and more states legalize gambling, it looks like casino gaming will continue to grow in popularity.
