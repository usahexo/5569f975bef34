#  Quarter Slot in Washing Machine? Break It with a Spoon!

It’s happened to all of us. You go to do a load of laundry, and you notice that the quarter slot in your washing machine is full. You try to take the quarters out, but they’re stuck. What do you do?

Some people might try to break the quarters out with a spoon. Others might try to use a screwdriver or a butter knife. But what if there was an easier way?

The easiest way to get those quarters out is by using a paper clip. Just bend the paper clip into a small “U” shape, and fit it into the quarter slot. Then twist the paper clip until the quarters come loose.

This method works because the paper clip is thin enough to fit into the slot, but also strong enough to twist loose the quarters. Plus, it’s easy and fast to do – no need for any tools!

#  The Best Way to Break the Quarter Slot in Washing Machines

If you’re like most people, you probably think that the only way to break the quarter slot in a washing machine is by inserting a coin and trying to pull it out. However, this is not the only way to do it. There are actually a few different methods that you can use to break the quarter slot in a washing machine, and in this article, we will be discussing some of the best ways to do it.

One way to break the quarter slot in a washing machine is by using a paper clip. To do this, you will need to insert the paper clip into the slot and then twist it until it breaks. If you are having difficulty getting it to break, you can try using a pair of pliers or a hammer to help you get it done.

Another way to break the quarter slot in a washing machine is by using a screwdriver. This method is similar to the paper clip method in that you will need to insert the screwdriver into the slot and twist it until it breaks. However, you will also need to use some force when twisting the screwdriver, so make sure that you are prepared for that before trying this method.

Finally, if neither of those methods seem like they will work for you, there is always the option of using a knife. This method can be a bit dangerous if you are not careful, so make sure that you are aware of what you are doing before trying it. To do this, simply insert the knife into the slot and twist it until it breaks.
