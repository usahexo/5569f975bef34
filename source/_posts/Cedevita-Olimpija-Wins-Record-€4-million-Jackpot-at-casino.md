Cedevita Olimpija, one of the most successful teams in the history of Croatian basketball, has won a record €4 million jackpot at a casino.

The jackpot was won at the Casino Admiral in Zagreb and represents the biggest win ever by a Croatian gambling institution.

“We are absolutely thrilled with this result. Cedevita Olimpija is one of the best basketball teams in Europe and we hope they use this money to make even more history,” said a spokesperson for the casino.

Cedevita Olimpija player Luka Doncic hit a €805,000 blackjack win at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. The 19-year-old phenom was dining with friends at
FlamingoSwitch Tapas Kitchen & Bar when he decided to take a seat at the blackjack table.
Doncic started with a modest bet of $25 and proceeded to win nine hands in a row. He increased his stake with each victory and eventually walked away with the biggest jackpot in casino history.

"I'm feeling great," said Doncic after his big win. "This is my first time in Las Vegas and I'm really happy with how things have gone so far."

While Doncic is enjoying his success on the casino floor, he's also been shining on the basketball court. As a member of Cedevita Olimpija, he helped lead the team to a championship in the Slovenian League. He was also named MVP of both the Liga ACB and EuroLeague Rising Star Awards.

In recognition of his accomplishments, Doncic was recently drafted #3 overall by the Dallas Mavericks in the 2017 NBA Draft. With Dirk Nowitzki nearing retirement, Doncic could be poised to become one of the league's most dynamic players.
