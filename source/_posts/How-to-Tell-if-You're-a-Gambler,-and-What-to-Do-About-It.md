#  How do I know if gambling has taken over my life?

It can be tough to know if gambling has taken over your life. After all, aren’t we all just a little bit addicted to the thrill? The answer is, unfortunately, that it often starts off innocently enough, but over time can become a problem. Here are four signs that gambling may have taken over your life:

1. You’re spending more money on gambling than you intended to.

If you’re finding yourself gambling more and more money, then there’s a good chance that it has taken over your life. Gambling can be an expensive habit, and before you know it you could be out of money and in debt.

2. You’re cancelling plans or skipping out on obligations to gamble instead.

If you’re finding that you’re making excuses not to see your friends or go to work because you’d rather gamble, then it’s definitely taking over your life. When gambling becomes a priority above everything else, it can be a sign that there is a problem.

3. You feel restless or irritable when you can't gamble.

If you find yourself feeling agitated or antsy whenever you can't gamble, then this is another sign that gambling has taken over your life. When something starts controlling our lives in this way, it's hard not to feel like we're missing out on something when we're not doing it.

4. You lie about how much money or time you spend gambling.

Lastly, if you find yourself lying to others about how much money or time you spend gambling, then this is definitely a sign that something is wrong. When we start hiding our behaviour from others it usually means that we know deep down that what we're doing isn't right.

#  Are You at Risk for Gambling Addiction?

Almost everyone has gambled at some point in their lives, but for some people gambling can become a problem. Gambling addiction is a serious condition that can have negative consequences on your life, including your mental and physical health, job, relationships, and finances.

If you are concerned that you or someone you know may be addicted to gambling, there are some signs to look out for. For example, do you find yourself thinking about gambling all the time? Do you spend more money than you intended on gambling? Do you feel like you need to gamble to feel good or calm down? Are you so preoccupied with gambling that it interferes with your daily activities? If you answer yes to any of these questions, it is possible that you may have a gambling addiction.

If you think you may be addicted to gambling, it is important to seek help. There are many treatment options available, and with the right support and treatment, you can overcome your addiction and start living a healthier life.
