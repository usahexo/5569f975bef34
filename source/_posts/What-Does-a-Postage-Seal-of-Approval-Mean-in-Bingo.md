#  What Are the Criteria for Getting a Postage Seal of Approval in Bingo?

In order to obtain a postage seal of approval in Bingo, there are a few criteria that must be met. The first and most important is that the envelope or package being mailed must be of sufficient weight. The United States Postal Service requires that all packages and envelopes sent via first-class mail have a minimum thickness of .007 inches. Additionally, the package or envelope cannot be too large or too small. There is also a size limit for packages, as they cannot weigh more than 70 pounds nor can they be less than four ounces. Finally, the package or envelope being mailed must have a valid stamp on it.

If all of these criteria are met, then the Bingo stamp will be affixed to the mail piece and it will be sent on its way. If any of these criteria are not met, then the mail piece will not be approved for postage and will not be sent. It is important to remember that only first-class mail is eligible for a Bingo postage seal of approval – parcels, priority mail, and other types of mail do not qualify.

The Bingo postage seal of approval is a coveted symbol that tells recipients that their mail has been screened by experts and meets all the requirements of the USPS. This allows recipients to rest assured that their mail will arrive quickly and safely at its destination.
