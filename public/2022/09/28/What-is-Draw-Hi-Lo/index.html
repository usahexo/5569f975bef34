        <h1 id="What-is-Draw-Hi-Lo"><a href="#What-is-Draw-Hi-Lo" class="headerlink" title="What is Draw Hi-Lo?"></a>What is Draw Hi-Lo?</h1><p>Draw Hi-Lo is a casino game that is played with a deck of 52 cards. The aim of the game is to make as much money as possible by predicting whether the next card will be higher or lower than the current one.</p>
<p>Players place their bets on either the ‘Hi’ or ‘Lo’ box, and then draw a card. If the next card is higher than the current one, the player wins and their profits for that hand are equal to their original bet multiplied by 2. If the next card is lower than the current one, the player loses and their bet is forfeited.</p>
<p>The game can be played with any amount of money that you like, but it’s recommended that you stake small amounts in order to increase your chances of winning. For example, if you bet $1 each time you play, your potential profits would be $2 if you win, but you would only lose $1 if you lose.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-I-play"><a href="#How-do-I-play" class="headerlink" title="How do I play?"></a>How do I play?</h1><p>To play Draw Hi-Lo, all you need to do is decide whether you think the next card will be higher or lower than the current one. You can then place your bet on the ‘Hi’ or ‘Lo’ box on the table. Once all players have placed their bets, each player draws a card from the deck. The player who has drawn the highest card will start by flipping over their card. The following player then flips over their card, and so on until both cards have been revealed. If at any time it becomes impossible to determine which hand is higher (e.g. both players have an Ace), then all bets are refunded and a new hand is started with a new deck of cards.</p>
<p>If the first two cards are of equal value (e.g. two Kings), then this is known as a ‘push’ and no one wins or loses money on that particular hand. In some casinos, players are given the option to Double Down if they want to risk more money in order to win more profits. To Double Down, players must double their original bet and then draw another card from the deck (this replaces their original two cards). If they choose to Double Down and they subsequently win, they will receive double their profits (i.e quadruple their original bet). However, if they lose when Doubling Down, they will forfeit their entire bet amount!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-play-Draw-Hi-Lo"><a href="#How-to-play-Draw-Hi-Lo" class="headerlink" title="How to play Draw Hi-Lo?"></a>How to play Draw Hi-Lo?</h1><p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>In this article, we are going to learn how to play Draw Hi-Lo. The game is easy to play and can be enjoyed by people of all ages.</p>
<p>To begin, each player is dealt five cards. The player with the highest card starts the round and must put that card face up on the table. The suit of that card does not matter. After the first player plays, the next player in turn either puts down a card from their hand that is higher than the previous card or they can draw one card from the deck and add it to their hand. If they cannot put down a higher card, then they must draw one from the deck and add it to their hand. If a player cannot put down a higher card or if they do not have any cards left in their hand, then they automatically lose the round. The game is over when one of the players has no more cards in their hand. The player with the highest total value of their cards at the end wins the game.</p>
<p>The basic strategy for playing this game is pretty simple - try to always keep one or two high numbers in your hand so you can put them down quickly if needed, while trying to avoid getting stuck with low number cards. You also want to make sure you don’t end up with too many cards of the same suit, as this can limit your options during a round.</p>
<p>Here are a few example hands so you can see how the game works:</p>
<h1 id="1-Player-1-has-an-Ace-of-Spades-and-a-3-of-Clubs"><a href="#1-Player-1-has-an-Ace-of-Spades-and-a-3-of-Clubs" class="headerlink" title="1) Player 1 has an Ace of Spades and a 3 of Clubs"></a>1) Player 1 has an Ace of Spades and a 3 of Clubs</h1><p>In this case, Player 1 would put down the Ace of Spades and then take another card from the deck to add to their hand (since they cannot put down another Ace).</p>
<h1 id="2-Player-2-has-a-5-of-Diamonds-and-a-6-of-Hearts"><a href="#2-Player-2-has-a-5-of-Diamonds-and-a-6-of-Hearts" class="headerlink" title="2) Player 2 has a 5 of Diamonds and a 6 of Hearts"></a>2) Player 2 has a 5 of Diamonds and a 6 of Hearts</h1><p>Player 2 would put down the 5 of Diamonds and then take another card from the deck (since they cannot put down another 5).</p>

<h1 id="What-are-the-different-types-of-bets-that-can-be-placed-in-a-game-of-Draw-Hi-Lo"><a href="#What-are-the-different-types-of-bets-that-can-be-placed-in-a-game-of-Draw-Hi-Lo" class="headerlink" title="What are the different types of bets that can be placed in a game of Draw Hi-Lo?"></a>What are the different types of bets that can be placed in a game of Draw Hi-Lo?</h1><p>There are a variety of different bets that can be placed in a game of Draw Hi-Lo. The most common bets are the bet on the high hand, the bet on the low hand, and the bet on the tie. In addition, there are also side bets that can be placed in the game.</p>
<p>The bet on the high hand is a wager on which player will have the highest hand at the end of the game. The bet on the low hand is a wager on which player will have the lowest hand at the end of the game. The bet on the tie is a wager on whether or not there will be a tie between any of the players’ hands.</p>
<p>In addition to these three main bets, there are also side bets that can be placed in a game of Draw Hi-Lo. One such side bet is called “the wheel”, and it is a wager on whether or not one of the players will get a card that is both high and low. Another side bet is called “the scoop”, and it is a wager on whether or not one of the players will get both a high and low card in their hand.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-odds-of-winning-a-game-of-Draw-Hi-Lo"><a href="#What-are-the-odds-of-winning-a-game-of-Draw-Hi-Lo" class="headerlink" title="What are the odds of winning a game of Draw Hi-Lo?"></a>What are the odds of winning a game of Draw Hi-Lo?</h1><p>A game of Draw Hi-Lo is a simple card game in which players attempt to draw cards totaling either as low as possible (2-6), or as high as possible (7-A). The player who completes the requested total first, then lays down their card and announces the win. The other player must then either match the total with a card of their own, or fold and concede the hand.</p>
<p>In a game of Draw Hi-Lo, there are two ways to win: by either having the lowest total or the highest total. Because there are three 2s, three 3s, three 4s, etc., in a deck of 52 cards, the odds of being dealt any specific number are 1 in 13. Conversely, because there are only four Kings, Queens and Jacks in a deck, the odds of being dealt one of these cards are 4 in 52.</p>
<p>The odds of being dealt any given card can be calculated by dividing the number of possible outcomes by the number of desired outcomes. In our example game, this would be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>1&#x2F;13 for each card from 2 to 6<br>   4&#x2F;52 for each Jack, Queen or King</p>
