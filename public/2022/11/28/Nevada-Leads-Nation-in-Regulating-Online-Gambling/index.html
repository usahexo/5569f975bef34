        <h1 id="Nevada-Leads-Nation-in-Regulating-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-Nation-in-Regulating-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads Nation in Regulating Online Gambling"></a>Nevada Leads Nation in Regulating Online Gambling</h1><p>In the early days of online gambling, Nevada was the only state in the country to offer regulated internet poker and casino games. The state has continued to lead the way in regulating and licensing online gaming operators, and this leadership is now paying off in terms of tax revenue.</p>
<p>Since 2013, when Nevada began regulating online gambling, the state has taken in over $60 million in taxes from operators. This represents a significant contribution to Nevada’s overall budget, and it is likely that this number will continue to grow as more states legalize online gambling.</p>
<p>Nevada’s success with online gambling can be attributed to a number of factors. First, the state has been quick to license reputable operators who are able to provide a high-quality experience for players. Second, Nevada has been effective in enforcing regulations and punishing operators who violate the rules. Finally, the state has worked with other jurisdictions to create a safe and secure online gaming environment for players.</p>
<p>Nevada’s success with online gambling is likely to continue into the future. With more states moving towards legalization, Nevada stands to benefit from increased tax revenue and a larger player base.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Enacts-Laws-for-Online-Gambling-Casino"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Enacts-Laws-for-Online-Gambling-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Enacts Laws for Online Gambling Casino"></a>Pennsylvania Enacts Laws for Online Gambling Casino</h1><p>Pennsylvania is the fourth state in the US to legalize and regulate online gambling. The state’s new gaming law, which was signed into effect by Governor Tom Wolf on October 30th, authorizes licensed casinos in the state to offer slots, table games, and poker online.</p>
<p>As part of the new law, PA residents must be 21 years or older to gamble online. Players will also be required to set up an account with a licensed casino and make a deposit in order to play. Online casinos will be required to verify players’ identities and age before allowing them to wager.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) will be responsible for regulating online gambling in the state. The PGCB will create guidelines for online casinos, including rules on how much players can bet and how often they can withdraw their winnings.</p>
<p>The PGCB plans to have regulations in place for online gambling by May 2019. At that time, licensed casinos will be able to start offering games online. So far, five casinos have been approved to offer online gambling: Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, Parx Casino, SugarHouse Casino, Rivers Casino Pittsburgh, and Mohegan Sun Pocono.</p>
<h1 id="California-Close-to-Passing-Online-Poker-Regulations"><a href="#California-Close-to-Passing-Online-Poker-Regulations" class="headerlink" title="California Close to Passing Online Poker Regulations"></a>California Close to Passing Online Poker Regulations</h1><p>The California Assembly is close to passing a bill that would regulate online poker within the state.</p>
<p>AB 1677, introduced by Assemblyman Adam Gray in February, would establish the framework for the licensing and regulation of internet poker operators in California.</p>
<p>Gray explained that his goal is to legalize and regulate online poker in order to protect California’s consumers and generate tax revenue for the state.</p>
<p>The bill has been carefully crafted over the past several months with input from a variety of stakeholders, including tribal casinos, card rooms, and racetracks.</p>
<p>AB 1677 would create two types of licenses – one for PokerStars and other large, international operators, and another for smaller, regional operators.</p>
<p>Tribal casinos have voiced support for the bill, but some card rooms are opposed, arguing that it gives PokerStars an unfair advantage.</p>
<p>The bill passed the Assembly Appropriations Committee on a unanimous vote last week and now heads to the full Assembly for a vote. It is unclear whether there is enough support to pass it into law.</p>
<h1 id="Iowa-Advances-Legislation-Regarding-Internet-Gambling"><a href="#Iowa-Advances-Legislation-Regarding-Internet-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Iowa Advances Legislation Regarding Internet Gambling"></a>Iowa Advances Legislation Regarding Internet Gambling</h1><p>Iowa lawmakers have made a push for legislation that would legalize and regulate internet gambling within the state. The proposal, which was introduced by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Thursday, is seen as a way to bring in new revenue for the state, as well as create jobs.</p>
<p>“This is about bringing gaming out of the shadows and into the light,” McCarthy said in a statement. “It’s about creating good-paying jobs, boosting economic development and generating new revenue for Iowa.”</p>
<p>The proposed bill would allow Iowans over 21 years of age to bet on casino games, sports, and horse races using their computers or mobile devices. It would also establish a licensing and regulatory framework for internet gambling operators. Revenue generated from online gambling would be used to reduce property taxes and fund other priorities such as education and infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>While there is no exact count on how much revenue internet gambling could generate for Iowa, similar proposals elsewhere have yielded millions of dollars in tax revenue. For example, New Jersey collected more than $200 million in internet gambling taxes in 2017 alone.</p>
<p>Sponsors of the Iowa proposal believe that it could be a major boon to the state economy, creating hundreds of jobs in the process. The bill has already garnered bipartisan support in the House, with over 30 sponsors signing on so far. It will now head to the Committee on Commerce where it will be debated and voted on.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Implements-Laws-Governing-Online-Gaming-Sites"><a href="#Delaware-Implements-Laws-Governing-Online-Gaming-Sites" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Implements Laws Governing Online Gaming Sites"></a>Delaware Implements Laws Governing Online Gaming Sites</h1><p>The state of Delaware has been at the forefront of online gaming and gambling for many years. The state was one of the first to legalize online poker in 2012, and it has since expanded its offerings to include other popular casino games.</p>
<p>This week, Delaware officials announced that they had implemented new laws governing online gaming sites. The new laws are designed to protect players and ensure that the games are fair and safe.</p>
<p>Under the new laws, online gaming sites must be licensed by the state in order to offer their services to residents of Delaware. Players must be at least 21 years old in order to participate, and site operators must adhere to strict rules regarding responsible gaming.</p>
<p>In addition, the new laws require online gaming sites to pay taxes on their revenue. This is expected to help generate additional funding for the state’s coffers.</p>
<p>Delaware officials believe that the new laws will help make online gaming even more popular in the state. They expect that the added protections will make players feel more confident about playing on these sites, and that the extra revenue will help support vital government programs.</p>
