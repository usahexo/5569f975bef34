The study, which was published in the journal Addictive Behaviors, involved interviews with more than 400 people who were diagnosed with a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The researchers found that 44 percent of the participants said they gambled primarily at night, while only 17 percent said they gambled during the day. They also found that those who gambled at night were more likely to have problems with impulse control and to have a history of substance abuse.</p>
<p>“This study provides important preliminary evidence that evening gambling is associated with specific risks for gambling addiction,” said lead author Dr. Stephanie Reid. “It is unique in that it compares gambling behaviour between people with an addiction to gambling and those without, which has not been done before.”</p>
<p>The findings of this study could help to improve our understanding of gambling addiction and its causes, as well as identify ways to better treat this problem. It is hoped that this research will also help to raise awareness about the dangers of nighttime gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Do-Gamblers-Turn-to-Risky-Behavior-in-the-Dark"><a href="#Why-Do-Gamblers-Turn-to-Risky-Behavior-in-the-Dark" class="headerlink" title="Why Do Gamblers Turn to Risky Behavior in the Dark?"></a>Why Do Gamblers Turn to Risky Behavior in the Dark?</h1><p>Gamblers often resort to risky behavior in the dark, according to new research.</p>
<p>The study, published in the journal “Applied Cognitive Psychology”, found that when people can’t see their potential losses, they are more likely to make riskier bets.</p>
<p>“We showed that when people can’t see what they’re losing, they take greater risks,” said study author Dr. Michelle K. Duffy of the University of Minnesota. “This is because people tend to overestimate their chances of winning when they can’t see the potential losses.”</p>
<p>In the study, Duffy and her colleagues asked participants to play a computer game in which they made bets on whether a virtual coin would land on heads or tails. The catch was that some participants could see the potential losses (the amount of money they would lose if they bet incorrectly), while others could not.</p>
<p>The findings showed that participants who could not see their potential losses were more likely to make riskier bets than those who could see their losses.</p>
<p>This research has important implications for gambling behavior, according to Duffy.</p>
<p>“Our results suggest that casinos should keep their lights on at all times in order to reduce the risk of players making reckless bets,” said Duffy.</p>

Well, You Should Be If You Gamble"></a>Are You Afraid of the Dark? Well, You Should Be If You Gamble</h1><p>There’s a reason casino gaming has been glamorized in movies, television and popular culture over the years. It can be thrilling, entertaining and lucrative. At the same time, it can also be dangerous and addictive. Gambling can quickly become an all-consuming habit that negatively impacts every area of your life.</p>
<p>If you are someone who struggles with gambling addiction, you are not alone. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, 2 to 3 percent of the adult population in the United States suffers from some form of gambling addiction. That figure equates to between 6 and 9 million people.</p>
<p>Despite the high numbers, gambling addiction is still a largely hidden addiction. Many people who struggle with it are ashamed and do not want to admit they have a problem. They may also fear judgment from friends, family and coworkers.</p>
<p>The good news is that there is help available for those who suffer from gambling addiction. There are now many resources available both online and in-person that can help you get your life back on track.</p>
<p>If you believe you may have a gambling addiction, here are some signs to look for:</p>
<p>-You find yourself thinking about gambling more and more often<br>-You spend more time gambling than you intended to<br>-You’re experiencing financial problems as a result of your gambling habit<br>-You’re hiding your gambling habit from friends and family members<br>-You feel depressed or anxious when you’re not able to gamble<br>-You feel like you need to gamble in order to relax or feel good</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-in-the-Shadows-The-Scary-Reality-of-Late-Night-Gambling"><a href="#Gambling-in-the-Shadows-The-Scary-Reality-of-Late-Night-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Gambling in the Shadows: The Scary Reality of Late-Night Gambling"></a>Gambling in the Shadows: The Scary Reality of Late-Night Gambling</h1><p>Gambling in the shadows. That’s what it’s like to gamble late at night. It can be a scary, uncomfortable experience, particularly if you don’t know what you’re doing. </p>
<p>First and foremost, late-night gambling can be dangerous. You’re far more likely to encounter shady characters or establishments that are less than reputable. These places are often not as well-monitored as their daytime counterparts, putting your safety at risk. </p>
<p>In addition, late-night gambling is often less comfortable than gambling during the day. The casinos and gaming floors are often emptier, meaning there’s less opportunity for socializing or winning big pots. If you’re looking for a fun, exciting gambling experience, then nighttime might not be the best time to do it. </p>
<p>Finally, late-night gambling can be more expensive than gambling during the day. This is because many of the better deals and discounts are offered during the day. In addition, you may have to pay more for food and drinks at night – and these can add up quickly! </p>
<p>So if you’re thinking of giving late-night gambling a try, be sure to keep in mind the above points. It can be a risky and uncomfortable experience – but it might just be worth it if you hit it big!</p>

The Answer Might Surprise You"></a>Is It Risky to Gamble After Dark? The Answer Might Surprise You</h1><p>It’s no secret that casino games can be a lot of fun. But what you may not know is that they can also be quite risky, especially if you gamble after dark.</p>
<p>The problem with gambling after dark is that it can be easy to get carried away. You may start out by betting a small amount of money, but before you know it, you’ve lost track of how much you’ve been wagering. This is when things can start to go downhill fast.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in this situation, it’s important to know when to stop. Unfortunately, many people don’t realize they’ve gone too far until it’s too late. And by that point, they may have already lost a lot of money.</p>
<p>So is it risky to gamble after dark? The answer is yes, it can be. But that doesn’t mean you have to avoid casinos altogether. Just be mindful of how much you’re betting and try to stop when things start to get out of control.</p>
