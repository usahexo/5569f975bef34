        <h1 id="5B-wagered-on-Warriors-Cavaliers-Game-3"><a href="#5B-wagered-on-Warriors-Cavaliers-Game-3" class="headerlink" title="$5B wagered on Warriors-Cavaliers Game 3"></a>$5B wagered on Warriors-Cavaliers Game 3</h1><p>The betting action was intense on Game 3 of the NBA Finals Sunday, with a total of $5B wagered in Nevada sportsbooks. It was the largest amount ever bet on a single game in the Silver State.</p>
<p>The Warriors led wire-to-wire as they cruised to a 122-103 victory over the Cavaliers. Golden State covered the spread as 7.5-point favorites, and Stephen Curry finished with 33 points while Kevin Durant had 32.</p>
<p>“We had more money on the Warriors, but we also had more tickets on Cleveland, so it was actually close to a break-even for us,” said Jay Kornegay, vice president of race and sports at the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook.</p>
<p>The Cavaliers were 9.5-point underdogs in Game 3 but managed to cover the spread as they lost by 19 points. LeBron James had 23 points for Cleveland while Durant led all scorers with 33 points.</p>
<p>There was plenty of money wagered on the total as well, with most books setting the number at 220 or 221. The total went “over” 214 points scored in the game.</p>
<h1 id="1-5B-at-stake-in-Warriors-Cavaliers-Game-3"><a href="#1-5B-at-stake-in-Warriors-Cavaliers-Game-3" class="headerlink" title="$1.5B at stake in Warriors-Cavaliers Game 3"></a>$1.5B at stake in Warriors-Cavaliers Game 3</h1><p>The stakes could not be higher as the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers face off in Game 3 of the NBA Finals on Wednesday night. The Warriors currently lead the series 2-0, and a victory in Game 3 would give them a virtually insurmountable 3-0 lead. A loss, on the other hand, would leave the Cavaliers with their backs against the wall as they would need to win four of the next five games to take home the championship.</p>
<p>The Warriors are led by superstar Stephen Curry, who is averaging 31 points per game so far in the Finals. He is surrounded by a talented supporting cast that includes Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Andre Iguodala. The Cavaliers are led by LeBron James, who is averaging 28 points per game in the Finals. Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love are also playing well for Cleveland.</p>
<p>It should be an exciting game Wednesday night!</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-sportsbooks-take-in-8M-on-Warriors-Cavaliers-Game-3"><a href="#Nevada-sportsbooks-take-in-8M-on-Warriors-Cavaliers-Game-3" class="headerlink" title="Nevada sportsbooks take in $8M on Warriors-Cavaliers Game 3"></a>Nevada sportsbooks take in $8M on Warriors-Cavaliers Game 3</h1><p>The Golden State Warriors extended their lead in the NBA Finals with a 110-102 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 3 on Wednesday. The result was not a surprise, but the betting action was, as Nevada sportsbooks took in $8 million on the game.</p>
<p>65 percent of the money wagered on Wednesday’s game was on the Warriors to cover the -5.5-point spread, and they did just that. The Cavs were able to keep it close for most of the game, but Golden State pulled away in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>This is now the third consecutive year that Game 3 of the NBA Finals has resulted in a record for betting turnover at Nevada sportsbooks. Bettors wagered $10.4 million on last year’s Game 3 between the Warriors and Cavs, and $10.9 million on 2016’s matchup between Golden State and Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>The Warriors are now up 2-1 in this year’s Finals and can clinch their second championship in three years with a win in Game 4 on Friday night.</p>
<h1 id="10M-bet-on-Warriors-to-win-Finals-at-William-Hill-US-books"><a href="#10M-bet-on-Warriors-to-win-Finals-at-William-Hill-US-books" class="headerlink" title="$10M bet on Warriors to win Finals at William Hill US books"></a>$10M bet on Warriors to win Finals at William Hill US books</h1><p>The Golden State Warriors are 9.5-point favorites to win the NBA Finals at sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com, with the series starting on Thursday in Cleveland.</p>
<p>This means that a successful $10 bet on the Warriors would yield a profit of $19.50, while a wager on the Cavaliers would return just $8.80 for every $10 wagered.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that Golden State is such a big favorite heading into the Finals, as they topped the LeBron James-led Cavaliers during the regular season with a four-game sweep. The defending champions have since added Kevin Durant to their lineup, making them an even more daunting opponent.</p>
<p>Cleveland was able to overcome a 3-1 series deficit against the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, but it’s hard to see them duplicating that feat against Golden State.</p>
<p>The Warriors are averaging 118 points per game during the playoffs, while the Cavaliers are scoring just 107 points per game. With Stephen Curry and Durant leading the way, Golden State should have no trouble putting up plenty of points against Cleveland’s defense.</p>
<p>The Cavaliers may be able to keep things close in one or two games, but it’s hard to see them upsetting Golden State over the course of a seven-game series.</p>
<h1 id="Over-20M-bet-on-Warriors-Cavaliers-series-in-Las-Vegas"><a href="#Over-20M-bet-on-Warriors-Cavaliers-series-in-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Over $20M bet on Warriors-Cavaliers series in Las Vegas"></a>Over $20M bet on Warriors-Cavaliers series in Las Vegas</h1><p>The Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers are going to battle it out for the NBA Championship and the sports books in Las Vegas could not be happier.</p>
<p>According to a report from ESPN, over $20 million has been bet on the series thus far, with slightly more money betting on the Warriors to win.</p>
<p>This is not all that surprising given that the Warriors are the defending champs and currently have the best record in the NBA.</p>
<p>The Cavaliers, on the other hand, had to overcome some major hurdles to get to this point including a three-game sweep at the hands of the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals.</p>
<p>Many experts are expecting this series to be a close one, but most are giving Golden State a slight edge. The oddsmakers seem to agree as they have installed the Warriors as -260 favorites while Cleveland is +220 underdogs.</p>
