<p>A casino in Joliet, Illinois has been fined $5 million after an investigation found that its employees had been fixing games to let the casino always win.</p>
<p>The scheme involved blackjack dealers working with players to “ shuffle track ” the deck in a way that would give the casino an edge over other players. In some cases, dealers would even mark cards to help identify which ones would give the house an advantage.</p>
<p>“This conduct represents the most egregious and blatant form of cheating at a casino that I have ever seen,” said Attorney General Lisa Madigan.</p>
<p>The casino has agreed to pay the fine and has also agreed to implement a number of measures to prevent future incidents of cheating, including improved training for employees and surveillance cameras.</p>

<p>According to officials, the casino allegedly used a computer system that modified the game’s odds in its favor. This would allow the casino to win regardless of how well or poorly customers played.</p>
<p>Investigators say that the system was used for several years before it was finally caught. Officials are still trying to determine how much money the casino made as a result of the scheme.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that allegations of this nature have surfaced against a casino. In fact, similar schemes have been uncovered at casinos across the country. In most cases, however, casinos are able to skirt punishment by paying a small fine.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what happens in this case, as Illinois has some of the strictest gambling laws in the country. If the casino is found guilty, it could face significant penalties, including being shut down entirely.</p>

<p>According to investigators, casino employees deliberately made it more difficult for gamblers to win at blackjack and roulette by using hidden buttons to adjust game odds, and then lied to players about the results.</p>
<p>“Downtown Grand Las Vegas admitted to and cooperated with our investigation and has taken meaningful corrective actions,” said Nevada Gaming Control Board Chairman A.G. Burnett in a statement. “Nevertheless, as the regulator of gaming in Nevada, we must levy a significant penalty to send a message that this type of conduct will not be tolerated.”</p>
<p>The Downtown Grand also agreed to repay $1 million in gambling losses suffered by six players who were affected by the cheating.</p>
<p>This is just the latest in a series of fines levied against casinos caught rigging games. In July, four people affiliated with the Trump Taj Mahal casino were fined $10 million for similar offenses. And last year, The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas was fined $25 million for using software to altering poker games in favor of the house.</p>

The casino has admitted that the property was able to win every time they played blackjack, but denies that they did anything wrong.</p>
<p>The casino says that they followed all of the rules when it came to the game of blackjack and that they believe that the property was just lucky. They say that they are sorry for any inconvenience that this may have caused their customers, but they maintain their innocence in the matter.</p>
<p>Investigators say that the casino allowed the property to play blackjack in a private room and that nobody else was allowed to join in on the game. They also say that the casino took care of all of the betting for the property and allowed them to keep all of the winnings.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the casino has been in trouble with authorities. They were previously fined for rigging slot machines so that customers would lose money.</p>

<p>In a consent order issued by the Illinois Gaming Board on Wednesday, the casino was fined $25,000 for violating state gaming law. The board also revoked the casino’s license to conduct blackjack games.</p>
<p>According to the order, an investigation found that the casino property had an advantage over players in its blackjack games from July 1, 2017 to March 21, 2018.</p>
<p>“The (casino) property engaged in conduct that violated state gaming law by allowing itself to have an advantage over players,” the order said.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Illinois Casino has been fined for this issue. In January, the casino was fined $10,000 for violating state gaming law by allowing the property to always win at blackjack from July 1, 2016 to March 21, 2017.</p>
