        <h1 id="Tennessee-Titans-Ready-For-Series-Showdown-Against-Indianapolis-Colts"><a href="#Tennessee-Titans-Ready-For-Series-Showdown-Against-Indianapolis-Colts" class="headerlink" title="Tennessee Titans Ready For Series Showdown Against Indianapolis Colts"></a>Tennessee Titans Ready For Series Showdown Against Indianapolis Colts</h1><p>It is no secret that the Tennessee Titans have had a tough season. However, they are not out of the playoff race just yet. Sitting at 5-6, the Titans still have a chance to make it to the playoffs if they can manage to win their final three games.</p>
<p>The first of those games comes this Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts. The Colts come into this matchup with a record of 7-4, so they are definitely beatable. The Colts have been inconsistent this season, so the Titans have a good chance of winning if they can play their best football.</p>
<p>One thing that could work in the Titans’ favor is that the Colts will be without Andrew Luck. Luck has been dealing with a shoulder injury and there is no guarantee that he will be able to return this season. Without their star quarterback, the Colts offense will be much less potent.</p>
<p>Of course, the Titans cannot take the Colts lightly. They still have players like T.Y. Hilton and Jack Doyle who can make big plays. The Titans will need to execute well on both sides of the ball if they want to come away with a victory on Sunday.</p>
<p>If they can manage to win their final three games, the Titans will clinch a playoff spot and could potentially make a run in January. This would be an impressive turnaround for a team that started off 0-3 this season.</p>
<p>The man leading this charge for the Titans is Marcus Mariota. Mariota has been up and down this season, but he has shown flashes of brilliance at times. He will need to continue playing well if the Titans want to make a run in the playoffs.</p>
<p>Overall, there is still plenty left to play for in Nashville. The Titans may not be favored in this game against Indianapolis, but stranger things have happened in the NFL. If they play their best football, they have a good chance of coming away with a victory on Sunday</p>
<h1 id="What-Does-Series-Mean-In-Sports-Betting"><a href="#What-Does-Series-Mean-In-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="What Does Series Mean In Sports Betting?"></a>What Does Series Mean In Sports Betting?</h1><p>Series betting is a popular form of sports betting where bettors wager on the outcome of multiple events. The events can be any combination of individual matchups, games, or races. Bettors can win money by correctly predicting the outcomes of all events in the series, some of the outcomes, or just one outcome.</p>
<p>Series betting can be done on any sport, but it is most commonly used in horse racing, tennis, and golf. In horse racing, bettors will wager on the order of finish for each race in a series. For example, they may bet on which horse will win the first race, which will finish second in the second race, and so on. In tennis and golf, bettors will typically bet on who they think will win each match in a series.</p>
<p>The potential payout for correctly predicting all outcomes in a series can be huge. However, it is also much more difficult to predict than simply guessing the winner of a single event. As a result, series betting usually offers lower odds than traditional wagering options.</p>
<p>In order to calculate potential payouts for series bets, bookmakers use what is called a “matrix.” This is essentially a table that shows how payouts are calculated for different combinations of outcomes. The matrix will vary from bookmaker to bookmaker, but typically pays out somewhere between 2-1 and 8-1 for correctly predicting all outcomes in a series.</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Bet-On-A-Series"><a href="#How-To-Bet-On-A-Series" class="headerlink" title="How To Bet On A Series"></a>How To Bet On A Series</h1><p>There are three basic ways to bet on a series: head-to-head matchups between two teams or horses&#x2F;golfers; over&#x2F;under bets on number of matches or races won by each team&#x2F;horse&#x2F;golfer; and proposition bets (also known as “prop bets”) on specific aspects of a matchup or event.</p>
<p>Head-to-head matchups are pretty self-explanatory: you’re betting on which team or horse will win the matchup. Over&#x2F;under bets are also simple: you’re predicting whether the total number of matches won by both teams combined will be over or under a certain number set by the bookmaker. And prop bets involve betting on specific aspects of an event such as who will score first, what the final margin of victory will be, and so on.</p>
<p>The vast majority of series bets are placed head-to-head or over&#x2F;under style wagers rather than prop bets. This is because these types of bets are easier to predict and offer better odds than prop bets do. However, there are always a few interesting prop bets available for major sporting events like the Super Bowl or Wimbledon Championships.</p>
<h1 id="Titans-Hope-To-Extend-Series-Lead-Against-Jaguars"><a href="#Titans-Hope-To-Extend-Series-Lead-Against-Jaguars" class="headerlink" title="Titans Hope To Extend Series Lead Against Jaguars"></a>Titans Hope To Extend Series Lead Against Jaguars</h1><p>In a battle of two teams from the AFC South, the Titans hope to pull ahead in the divisional race by defeating the Jaguars. With injuries mounting for Jacksonville, including the season-ending injury to starting quarterback Blake Bortles, Tennessee may have an advantage.</p>
<p>Despite being depleted on offense, the Jaguars defense has been one of the best in the league this year. Led by Calais Campbell and Jalen Ramsey, Jacksonville will be looking to slow down Tennessee’s offense and create some turnovers.</p>
<p>Tennessee has had its own share of injuries this season, including losing starting quarterback Marcus Mariota for several games. However, backup quarterback Blaine Gabbert has played well in Mariota’s absence and is looking to continue his success against Jacksonville.</p>
<p>The Titans will need to rely on their running game against Jacksonville’s stout defense. The combination of DeMarco Murray and Derrick Henry should be able to provide some yards on the ground. If they can control the clock and keep the Jaguars offense off the field, they have a good chance of winning this game.</p>
<p>This should be a good defensive battle between two playoff contenders. The Jaguars are playing at home, but with all of their injuries I would give the Titans the edge in this game.</p>
<h1 id="Broncos-Eyeing-3-Game-Series-Sweep-Over-Raiders"><a href="#Broncos-Eyeing-3-Game-Series-Sweep-Over-Raiders" class="headerlink" title="Broncos Eyeing 3-Game Series Sweep Over Raiders"></a>Broncos Eyeing 3-Game Series Sweep Over Raiders</h1><p>The Denver Broncos (3-1) will look to sweep the Oakland Raiders (0-4) in a three-game series when they square off on “Sunday Night Football”.</p>
<p>Oakland is coming off a 34-14 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in Week 4, while Denver suffered a 19-13 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>
<p>The Raiders have lost their last 13 games against the Broncos, last winning in 2011.</p>
<p>Denver quarterback Case Keenum is expected to start for the first time this season in place of the injured Brandon Allen, who is out with an ankle injury.</p>
<p>Keenum completed 23 of 32 passes for 292 yards and two touchdowns in a 27-24 win over the Raiders last season as a member of the Los Angeles Rams.</p>
<p>Raiders quarterback Derek Carr passed for 171 yards and two interceptions against Seattle. He has passed for 1,000 yards and six touchdowns with four interceptions in his last four games against Denver.</p>
<h1 id="Chargers-Chasing-Perfect-Series-Record-Against-Chiefs"><a href="#Chargers-Chasing-Perfect-Series-Record-Against-Chiefs" class="headerlink" title="Chargers Chasing Perfect Series Record Against Chiefs"></a>Chargers Chasing Perfect Series Record Against Chiefs</h1><p>For the first time in a while, the Chargers have some down time. They had a bye in Week 7, and will use this extra week of preparation to their advantage as they aim to stay undefeated against the Chiefs.</p>
<p>Kansas City is the next opponent on the Chargers schedule, and Philip Rivers and company are out for blood. Losing to the Chiefs twice last season was a thorn in their side, so they’ll be looking to even up the series record at 3-3.</p>
<p>The Chargers haven’t lost to KC since Andy Reid took over as head coach in 2013. However, the Chiefs have always been a thorn in their side. In fact, out of the 10 meetings between these two teams, KC has won 5 times.</p>
<p>But the Chargers are feeling good after their Week 7 bye. Their offense is clicking on all cylinders, led by Rivers’ stellar play. With Melvin Gordon also playing well and Keenan Allen back from injury, they should be able to put up points against KC’s defense.</p>
<p>The Chiefs have been struggling this season with a 2-4 record. Mahomes has been impressive at times but has also made some costly mistakes. The defense has also been porous at times, giving up big plays. This could be a recipe for disaster against a high-powered Chargers offense.</p>
<p>All signs point to the Chargers continuing their dominance over KC this Sunday. With a perfect record against their AFC West rivals on the line, expect them to come out firing on all cylinders</p>
