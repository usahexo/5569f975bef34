<p>Governor Phil Murphy signed the bill into law on June 11, and there’s already a rush to get online betting licences.</p>
<p>However, not everyone will be able to offer sports betting in the state. The law says that only casino licensees and racetrack licensees can offer sports betting.</p>
<p>In other words, Atlantic City casinos and Monmouth Park Racetrack are the only places you can place a legal sports bet in New Jersey right now.</p>
<p>Some of Pennsylvania’s casinos are also looking to offer sports betting in New Jersey. Sands Bethlehem is one of them, and they’re hoping to partner with an Atlantic City casino to offer their services.</p>
<p>But there’s some competition from Las Vegas casino operators too. MGM Resorts International is looking to expand into New Jersey, and they’ve already partnered with Boyd Gaming Corporation for a joint venture called BorgataBET.</p>

<h1 id="NJ-Governor-Orders-Review-of-Sports-Betting-Licenses"><a href="#NJ-Governor-Orders-Review-of-Sports-Betting-Licenses" class="headerlink" title="NJ Governor Orders Review of Sports Betting Licenses"></a>NJ Governor Orders Review of Sports Betting Licenses</h1><p>Overnight, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy ordered a review of the state’s sports betting licenses and associated regulations. The move comes just one day after Murphy was sworn in as the Garden State’s 56th governor.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Governor said that Murphy wants to ensure that “New Jersey residents have access to this new form of entertainment in a safe and responsible manner.” The order calls for the state Attorney General’s office to review all aspects of the state’s regulatory framework for sports betting, including licensing requirements, enforcement procedures, and consumer protections.</p>
<p>The order also directs the New Jersey Racing Commission to develop new rules governing sports betting at racetracks. These rules would be designed to protect consumers and ensure a level playing field for all operators.</p>
<p>The news comes as no surprise given Murphy’s long-standing support for legalized sports betting. As a candidate, he pledged to “fully legalize sports betting in New Jersey” within his first 100 days in office. And in December, he released a detailed plan outlining how he would do it.</p>
<p>So far, only four states - Nevada, Delaware, New York, and West Virginia - have authorized full-scale sports betting operations. But that is likely to change soon as more states move to legalize the activity in light of last month’s Supreme Court ruling striking down a federal ban on sports betting.</p>
<p>Murphy’s order is sure to please the many New Jersey businesses that are hoping to get into the sports betting market. These include casinos, racetracks, and online gaming companies. They see sports betting as a potentially lucrative new revenue stream at a time when other forms of gambling are becoming increasingly saturated.</p>
<h1 id="Who-Can-Take-Over-the-New-Jersey-Sports-Betting-Scene"><a href="#Who-Can-Take-Over-the-New-Jersey-Sports-Betting-Scene" class="headerlink" title="Who Can Take Over the New Jersey Sports Betting Scene?"></a>Who Can Take Over the New Jersey Sports Betting Scene?</h1><p>The New Jersey sports betting scene has been in the news a lot lately. With the repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), individual states are now allowed to legalize and regulate sports betting. This development has led to a lot of speculation about who will take over the New Jersey sports betting market.</p>
<p>There are a few contenders for this title. The first is Atlantic City casinos, which have been struggling in recent years. The legalization of sports betting could be just what they need to revive their fortunes. Another possibility is racetracks, which have been pushed out of the gambling market in recent years by casinos. Sports betting could give them a new lease on life.</p>
<p>Another possibility is telecom companies like Verizon and AT&amp;T. These companies have been pushing for the repeal of PASPA for years, and they stand to make a lot of money from legalized sports betting. Finally, there are the online gambling companies like PokerStars and 888 Holdings, which are likely to dominate the New Jersey sports betting market.</p>
<p>So far, none of these contenders has emerged as a clear favorite. It remains to be seen who will take over the New Jersey sports betting scene.</p>
<h1 id="DelawareSportsBetting-com-Files-Lawsuit-Over-CampoBet-Closure"><a href="#DelawareSportsBetting-com-Files-Lawsuit-Over-CampoBet-Closure" class="headerlink" title="DelawareSportsBetting.com Files Lawsuit Over CampoBet Closure"></a>DelawareSportsBetting.com Files Lawsuit Over CampoBet Closure</h1><p>On Friday, DelawareSportsBetting.com announced they were filing a lawsuit against CampoBet over the sudden closure of the site.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Delaware, alleges that CampoBet violated the terms of their operating agreement by abruptly shutting down without notice.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, CampoBet was required to give DelawareSportsBetting.com 90 days notice before closing, which did not happen.</p>
<p>“We’re extremely disappointed in how CampoBet has handled this situation,” said DelawareSportsBetting.com CEO Brian London. “We put a lot of time and effort into building CampoBet into a successful business, and it’s unfair that we’ve been treated this way.”</p>
<p>CampoBet has not yet commented on the lawsuit.</p>
<h1 id="State-Senator-Wants-probe-into-CampoBet-sports-betting-closure"><a href="#State-Senator-Wants-probe-into-CampoBet-sports-betting-closure" class="headerlink" title="State Senator Wants probe into CampoBet sports betting closure"></a>State Senator Wants probe into CampoBet sports betting closure</h1><p>California state senator Marc Levine has asked the chairs of the state’s two gambling regulatory agencies to investigate the closure of CampoBet, an online sportsbook based in the state. The senator said that he was “extremely troubled” by the news and wants to know why the book was shuttered without warning and with no explanation offered to customers.</p>
<p>Campobet had been operational since early 2018, and was one of just a handful of licensed sportsbooks in California. The company abruptly closed its doors on September 10, leaving players without access to their funds and no explanation for the closure. In a letter addressed to Karen Antee, chairwoman of the California Gambling Control Commission, and Richard Gillihan, chairman of the California Horse Racing Board, Levine writes:</p>
<p>“The sudden closure of CampoBet without warning and with no explanation offered to customers is extremely troubling. I am requesting that your agencies investigate this matter and provide a thorough report regarding CampoBet’s operations.”</p>
<p>Levine also requested information about any financial or regulatory issues that may have led to the closure, as well as what steps have been taken to ensure that customers will be repaid their money. He also asked for assurances that regulators are doing all they can to protect consumers from future incidents like this.</p>
<p>Representatives from both commissions told local media that they are looking into the situation, but they declined to offer further details.</p>
