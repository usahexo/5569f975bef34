<p>This was revealed by PAO Chairman Andrea Domingo in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Domingo said that the agency is working with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to build a case against those involved in illegal sports betting.</p>
<p>She added that the PAO would also be seeking cooperation from other government agencies to help in the crackdown on this illegal activity.</p>
<p>“Illegal gambling, particularly unlicensed sports betting, is rampant and continues to victimize ordinary Filipinos who are enticed into plunking down their hard-earned money on the ‘sure thing,’” Domingo said.</p>
<p>She pointed out that this form of gambling is especially harmful to the poor, who often lose all their money in bets.</p>
<p>The PAO is hoping that its case against illegal sports betting will help to reduce this problem in the country.</p>
<h1 id="PAO-announces-plans-to-take-on-the-Panathinaikos-betting-scandal"><a href="#PAO-announces-plans-to-take-on-the-Panathinaikos-betting-scandal" class="headerlink" title="PAO announces plans to take on the Panathinaikos betting scandal!"></a>PAO announces plans to take on the Panathinaikos betting scandal!</h1><p>ΠΑΟ Ανακοινώνει στρατηγικές για το αθλητικό του σκάνδαλο με τον Παναθηναϊκό</p>
<p>The scandal that has rocked Greek football this season just took a new turn, as PAO announced plans to take on Panathinaikos. The allegations concern matchfixing and illegal betting, with PAO claiming that their rivals have been involved in these practices for years.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that PAO has spoken out against Panathinaikos – they have previously alleged that the team from Athens has been using unfair tactics to gain an advantage. However, this is the first time that they have threatened to take legal action.</p>
<p>PAO’s president, Ivan Savvidis, stated that they have “evidence of systematic match-fixing over many years” and warned that they will not hesitate to take legal action against Panathinaikos and their officials. He also said that they would be seeking financial compensation from the team, as well as other measures to punish them for their actions.</p>
<p>This announcement comes after a difficult few months for PAO. They were relegated from the Greek Superleague after finishing in last place, and their president Savvidis was banned from all football-related activity for entering the pitch with a gun during a game. However, it now seems that they are determined to get revenge on Panathinaikos – and it could lead to some major changes in Greek football.</p>
<h1 id="PAO-to-take-action-against-state-for-failing-to-prevent-illegal-gambling-on-games"><a href="#PAO-to-take-action-against-state-for-failing-to-prevent-illegal-gambling-on-games" class="headerlink" title="PAO to take action against state for failing to prevent illegal gambling on games!"></a>PAO to take action against state for failing to prevent illegal gambling on games!</h1><p>The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) has announced that it will be taking legal action against the state of Philippines for its failure to prevent illegal gambling on games such as basketball and football.</p>
<p>In a statement, PAGCOR Chair Andrea Domingo said that the agency would be filing a case with the Supreme Court of the Philippines, seeking damages for the state’s inaction in preventing illegal gambling. She added that the agency had warned the government about the issue more than a year ago, but that no action had been taken.</p>
<p>PAGCOR is seeking damages amounting to PHP 1 billion (US$ 19 million), which it claims has been lost as a result of illegal gambling. The agency also stated that it would be suspending its operations indefinitely until the government could provide assurances that illegal gambling would be prevented.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is a major problem in the Philippines, with estimates putting losses at around PHP 100 billion (US$ 2 billion) per year. Much of this is believed to come from online betting, with Football Pools and numbers games being particularly popular.</p>
<p>The news comes as a blow to the government of Philippines, which is already grappling with a number of other issues such as the ongoing Marawi siege and allegations of corruption against President Rodrigo Duterte.</p>
<h1 id="PAO-files-lawsuit-against-state-over-inaction-in-sports-betting-case"><a href="#PAO-files-lawsuit-against-state-over-inaction-in-sports-betting-case" class="headerlink" title="PAO files lawsuit against state over inaction in sports betting case!"></a>PAO files lawsuit against state over inaction in sports betting case!</h1><p>On Tuesday, the PAO filed a lawsuit against the state of New Jersey over its inaction on sports betting. The PAO is seeking to compel the state to take action in the case and move it forward.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in Superior Court in Mercer County. It argues that the state’s failure to act is a violation of the New Jersey Constitution. Specifically, it cites Article IV, Section VII, which states that “all suits at law … shall be tried by a jury.”</p>
<p>The PAO is seeking an order from the court compelling the state to take action in the case. This would include setting a deadline for oral arguments and issuing a ruling.</p>
<p>“The PAO has a duty to enforce the Constitution and protect the rights of New Jersey residents,” said PAO Chief Counsel Matthew Metzgar in a statement. “We are asking the court to order the state to do its job and provide justice for New Jerseyans.”</p>
<p>In February, a federal judge ruled that New Jersey could not allow sports betting because it violated federal law. The state has asked for an appeal of that ruling, but so far there has been no action taken by the court.</p>
<p>“The state has sat on its hands for far too long,” said Metzgar. “It’s time for them to act and stop violating our Constitution.”</p>
<h1 id="Panathinaikos-announces-legal-action-against-illegal-sports-betting"><a href="#Panathinaikos-announces-legal-action-against-illegal-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Panathinaikos announces legal action against illegal sports betting"></a>Panathinaikos announces legal action against illegal sports betting</h1><p>Athletic club Panathinaikos announced on Monday that it will take legal action against illegal sports betting, according to a statement released by the club.</p>
<p>The announcement comes after revelations that the president of PAOK Salonika, Ivan Savvidis, had bet on his own team to lose a match over the weekend.</p>
<p>Α statement from Panathinaikos’ management said that the club “will exhaust all legal means in order to protect its interests and those of its fans.”</p>
<p>The football league has also announced that it is launching an investigation into the matter.</p>
