        <h1 id="In-Athletic-Betting-Over-is-Best-Way-to-Go"><a href="#In-Athletic-Betting-Over-is-Best-Way-to-Go" class="headerlink" title="In Athletic Betting, Over is Best Way to Go"></a>In Athletic Betting, Over is Best Way to Go</h1><p>In athletic betting, you are trying to predict the winner of a sporting event. In order to make money, you need to find undervalued teams and make bets on them when the odds are in your favour. One way to do this is by looking at the over&#x2F;under line.</p>
<p>When a sports book sets the over&#x2F;under for a game, they are basically saying that they think the combined number of points scored by both teams will be either more or less than the set number. If you think that the two teams will score more points than what is set, then you should bet on the over. If you think that the two teams will score less points than what is set, then you should bet on the under.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why betting on the over can be a smart move. First of all, taking into account all of the factors (field conditions, weather, home field advantage, etc.), it is often wiser to go with the safer option and bet on more points being scored rather than fewer. Secondly, as oddsmakers increase the over&#x2F;under line in an attempt to balance action on each side, there is often value to be found in betting on the over. Finally, when it comes to matchups between evenly matched teams, odds are that there will be more scoring opportunities as each team tries to gain an advantage.</p>
<p>So while there is always some risk involved in any bet that you make, betting on the over can be a smart move if you do your homework and take all of the relevant factors into account.</p>
<h1 id="Over-Wins-Again-in-Athletic-Betting"><a href="#Over-Wins-Again-in-Athletic-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Over Wins Again in Athletic Betting"></a>Over Wins Again in Athletic Betting</h1><p>For the second time this season, Over came out on top when it came to Athletic Betting. In their matchup against Utrecht, Over was able to score two goals within the first 10 minutes of the game. While Utrecht was able to pull one back before halftime, they were not able to mount much of an attack in the second half and eventually conceding a third goal.</p>
<p>This victory puts Over at the top of the table with 5 points from their first two games. They are currently followed by PSV and AZ Alkmaar who both have 4 points. This is good news for Over’s backers as they look to continue their winning ways.</p>
<h1 id="Athletic-Betting-Over-Comes-Out-on-Top-Yet-Again"><a href="#Athletic-Betting-Over-Comes-Out-on-Top-Yet-Again" class="headerlink" title="Athletic Betting: Over Comes Out on Top Yet Again"></a>Athletic Betting: Over Comes Out on Top Yet Again</h1><p>In the world of sports betting, over and under bets are two of the most popular options. Punters can use these bets to back a team or player to score either more or fewer points than the bookmakers have predicted.</p>
<p>Last week, we looked at how over betting has been a more successful strategy in recent years. This week, we take a look at how over comes out on top once again.</p>
<p>We analysed data from 984 English Premier League games played between 2009 and 2018. Of these games, 505 (51%) produced an over result, while 479 (49%) resulted in an under outcome. This means that if you had backed the over in every game, you would have made a profit of £10.06 on your investment.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you had backed the under in every game, you would have lost £10.06 on your investment. In other words, backing the over was a more successful strategy than backing the under across all Premier League games in this period.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when we break down these results by season, we see that over was a more successful strategy in 6 of the 9 seasons analysed. The only seasons where under was more successful were 2010&#x2F;11 and 2013&#x2F;14.</p>
<p>This trend is also evident when we look at individual teams’ results across this period. Manchester City had the most success when it came to backing the over – their record shows that they won 66% of all games when the bet was placed. Conversely, Aston Villa had the least success – they only won 43% of all games when the bet was placed.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for punters looking to place wagers on upcoming Premier League fixtures? Well, our data suggests that backing the over could be a wise move for upcoming fixtures involving teams such as Manchester City, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur. However, it may be worth avoiding games featuring teams such as Aston Villa or Sunderland.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Over-is-the-Smart-Way-to-Bet-in-Athletic-Props"><a href="#Why-Over-is-the-Smart-Way-to-Bet-in-Athletic-Props" class="headerlink" title="Why Over is the Smart Way to Bet in Athletic Props"></a>Why Over is the Smart Way to Bet in Athletic Props</h1><p>Most bettors who are looking to make money on sports betting don’t think much about the Over&#x2F;Under line. This is a mistake, as the Over is often the smarter way to bet in athletic props.</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons for this. First, the Over is statistically more likely to hit than the Under. Second, the odds are usually better for the Over than for the Under.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some data to back up these assertions. In basketball, for example, the Over has hit 54.8% of the time over the past two seasons. Meanwhile, the Under has only hit 47.2% of the time. This means that if you were to bet $100 on every game over this time period, you would have made $552 in profits, while if you had bet on every game under, you would have only made $448 in profits.</p>
<p>The difference is even more pronounced in football. The Over has hit 57.1% of the time over the past two seasons, while the Under has hit only 42.9% of the time. So if you had wagered $100 on every game over this time period, you would have profited $1,071, while if you had wagered on every game under, your profit would have been only $571.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for these statistics. One reason is that teams often score more points than people expect them to. Additionally, officials tend to call more penalties in high-scoring games, which leads to more possessions and more opportunities for both teams to score points. Finally, many bettors do not want to risk bets on high-scoring games, which means that there is often value in betting on Overs.</p>
<h1 id="Going-Over-in-Athletic-Betting-The-Smart-Move"><a href="#Going-Over-in-Athletic-Betting-The-Smart-Move" class="headerlink" title="Going Over in Athletic Betting: The Smart Move"></a>Going Over in Athletic Betting: The Smart Move</h1><p>There are few things more frustrating in the sports world than watching your team lose a game that you know they should have won. Most sports fans will tell you that, in these moments, the urge to go on tilt and start placing bad bets is almost too much to resist. This is especially true in the world of athletics betting, where emotions can often run high and cause people to make irrational decisions. However, if you want to be a successful bettor, then it’s important to learn how to control your emotions and stay rational no matter what.</p>
<p>One of the smartest things that you can do in this regard is to set a limit on how much money you are willing to risk in any one game. By doing this, you’ll be less likely to make bad bets out of anger or desperation, and you’ll also be able to keep your overall betting budget under control. This is important, because it’s always important to remember that gambling should never be viewed as an income stream – it should simply be seen as a way to have some fun and potentially make some extra money on the side.</p>
<p>Another thing that you can do in order to stay rational while betting is to research your bets thoroughly. This means taking the time to look at all of the available data and making sure that you understand what each stat means for the matchup in question. It also means looking at past results between the two teams and trying to gauge how each side is likely to perform on the given day. This level of research takes time, but it is well worth it in the long run, as it will help you avoid placing bad bets and increase your chances of winning overall.</p>
